# 🌙 The Dream Market – AI Short Film

## Inspiration
The Dream Market was born from a simple but haunting question:
What if dreams were objects you could buy, trade, or lose forever?

We imagined a wandering girl stepping into a surreal bazaar glowing with memory and light, searching for a dream she lost as a child. This project aims to blend cinematic visuals, lyrical narration, and emotional storytelling using AI tools that empower solo creators.

## What It Does
This project:
- Generates a full AI-powered short film
- Uses multimodal AI tools for visuals, video, voice, and music
- Tells a complete emotional story in under one minute
- Demonstrates a repeatable pipeline for AI filmmaking

## How I Built It
1. **Concept Art & Moodboards**  
   Using Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to establish the dreamlike world.

2. **AI Video Generation**  
   Runway Gen-2, Pika Labs, and Luma Dream Machine for animated scenes.

3. **Narration**  
   Script written manually, voice delivered using ElevenLabs.

4. **Music Production**  
   Suno and Soundraw to create soft, nostalgic ambient scoring.

5. **Video Editing**  
   CapCut and DaVinci Resolve for sequencing, cuts, transitions, and grading.

6. **Documentation**  
   All prompts, workflow, and reasoning stored in this GitHub repo.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Maintaining consistent characters across different AI tools  
- Getting dream imagery surreal but not chaotic  
- Timing narration and music to the emotional beats  
- Creating coherent visual style from multiple generation models  

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Built a visually poetic short film with solo-friendly tools  
- Designed a full AI filmmaking pipeline others can replicate  
- Crafted meaningful story and emotional pacing  
- Blended art + tech into a unified aesthetic  

## What I Learned
- Prompt engineering functions like creative direction  
- Audio dramatically lifts the emotional weight  
- Tweaking tiny details (glow, fog, color) changes entire tone  
- AI filmmaking thrives with clear constraints + narrative focus  

## What's Next for The Dream Market
- Expand to a 2–3 minute extended short  
- Add character-driven moments and dialogue  
- Create an interactive “buy your own dream” web app  
- Release a companion artbook generated entirely with AI
