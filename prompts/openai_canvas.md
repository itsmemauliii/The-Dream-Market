"A surreal floating marketplace suspended in a twilight sky, lit by thousands of glowing lanterns rising upward like fireflies. Stalls made of drifting clouds and fractal sand. A warm, nostalgic glow, soft fog, dreamy haze. A young girl standing at the entrance, holding an empty glass jar, looking in with longing. Hyper-detailed, painterly, cinematic realism with gentle magical lighting."
